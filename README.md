Sean's learning-spark project
=============================

This repo contains various Spark projects I've created to help learn spark for myself, teach others, present, and other useful information  I've accumulated.

## [Exactly Once Message Delivery with Kafka & Cassandra](exactlyonce/)

The [`exactlyonce`](exactlyonce/) project is a demonstration of implementing Exactly Once message delivery semantics with Spark Streaming, Kafka, and Cassandra.

## [StackOverflow.com Analysis](stackanalysis/)

The [`stackanalysis`](stackanalysis/) project analyzes StackOverflow.com post data to discover insights in regards to Scala questions asked on the site.

This project accompanied a [presentation](http://rawgit.com/seglo/learning-spark/master/presentation/learning-spark.html) for the [Scala Toronto](https://meetup.com/scalator) meetup group in the winter of 2015.

## [GitHub Events Streaming](githubstream/)

The [`githubstream`](githubstream/) project consumes data directly from the public Github Events API and demonstrates some common streaming capabilities of Apache Spark.

This project accompanied a [presentation](https://cdn.rawgit.com/seglo/learning-spark/master/presentation/spark-streaming-in-action/index.html) for the [Scala Up North](https://www.scalaupnorth.ca) Scala conference in the fall of 2015.
